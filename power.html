        <h1>
            Levels of Power
        </h1>
        <content style="font-size: 3.5vh">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the governments Britain in V for Vendetta and Oceanina in 1984 display a strong historic connection in maintaining balance of power between classes. This struggle for power can be seen in the real world of the time as well.
            For example, O'Brien describes how Winston is never going to achieve any sort of visible opposition against the party "<span class="quote">We are different from persecutors of the past...When you [Winston] finally surrender to us
            it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic... we convert him
            </span><span class="quotechar">"</span><span class="siting"> (Orwell Page 254)</span>. The "heretic" O'Brien refers to is a person who opposes the way Oceanic society is structured, thus the person, and therefore and class opposition is crushed 
            at the roots. The Party maintains control by removing all those who it sees unfit from the scene and this is very similar to class dissent in the 20th century. In Oceanic society, the true opressed people are those not part of the inner party,
            this is similar to those who were exploited in early industrial America. For example, when Unions were attempted to form, the government frequently sided with the companies and broke strikes, frequently with violence. This persists in V for Vendetta.
            In the beggining, when Chancellor Susan has a meeting right after V destroys the Bailey. <span class="quote">He describes how the government must take all steps to cover up the true cause of the Bailey's destruction while promoting the capture and extereme torture of V</span><span class="quotechar"></span><span class="siting">&nbsp;(V for Vendetta 11:05 to 13:07)</span>.
             V fights for the lower class who is not in Power in V for Vendetta, thus Chancellor Susan wants to supress him. Similarly to 1984, the government takes a policy of 
            complete denial of any rebellion happening in the country to maintain power over the lower class.
